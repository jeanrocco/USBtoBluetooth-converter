# USBtoBluetooth-converter
Convert a usb device to bluetooth using RPI pico (2)W

I am merely copying https://git.kkozai.com/kenji/pico_ble_hid excellent project here, as an archive, and my personnal rendition of it. 

As I was getting ready to buy a Bluetooth keyboard, to setup a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, I stumbled on this inexpensive USBtoBluetooth converter. I already had a Zero W
with soldered male headers, and instead of trying to desolder them, risky business, I chose to used female prototyping wires soldered to the USB individual cables, easy to do 
and error forgiving. Solder joints are protected with heatshrink tubing, and the whole gizmo fits in a pill bottle :-) .
